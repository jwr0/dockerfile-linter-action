# dockerfile-linter-action
A GitHub action for linting Dockerfiles and commenting on a PR with any errors.

## Usage

You should have something like this in your `./github/main.workflow`:
```
workflow "on pull request, Dockerfile lint" {
  on = "pull_request"
  resolves = ["Dockerfile lint"]
}

action "Dockerfile lint" {
  uses = "jwr0/dockerfile-linter-action"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
  # Optionally, if your Dockerfile is not in the root of your repository,
  # you can specify a DOCKERFILE environment variable with the path to
  # your Dockerfile
  env = {
    DOCKERFILE = "./some/other/directory/Dockerfile"
  }
}
```

As part of a pull request, the GitHub Action bot will comment with any
mistakes it found in your Dockerfile. Or if no mistakes are found, it won't
leave any comment.
